# Dennis Xiao

Employed as a web developer for a range of companies from tech start-ups and digital consultancies to international brands such as Study Group and China Telecom, with more than 10 commercial projects delivered.

I eat code snippets for breakfast, lunch and even dinner if necessary. I breathe in transistors and dream in algorithm. I geek out over learning and my IDEs are permanently open on every device. The letters JAVASCRIPT embellish the heart that's tattooed on my right shoulder. My favorite quote of all times is "Life is short. You need Python" from Bruce Eckel.
