# Dennis Xiao

A passionate and self-driven code ninja with a hungry for learning. Employed as a software engineer for a wide range of industries from tech start-up to well-known local and international brands, with 10+ commercial projects delivered. An ambitious IT professional looking for a position in a company that embraces innovative technologies and is as passionate as I am.

FUN FACTS: I eat code snippets for breakfast, lunch and even dinner if necessary. I breathe in transistors and dream in algorithm. I geek out over learning and my IDEs are permanently open on every device. The letters JAVASCRIPT embellish the heart that's tattooed on my right shoulder. My favourite quote of all times is "Life is short. You need Python" from Bruce Eckel. 🎉
